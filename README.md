**Club Judgin System**

The Club Judging System is a web-based figure skating scoring system. 
It plays off of the International Judging System and aims to improve on the organization and intuitiveness.
There are different pages for the skaters, technical specialists, and judges. (+ results!)
One thing is that, when scoring the programs, uesrs need to toggle between the tech specialist screen and judge screen for every element.
An oopsy due to the nature of Streamlit and session states!

How to use the project:
Make sure you have the database tables set up, then, in the terminal, type:
Streamlit run app.py
